# Canadian Municipal GitHub Rankings

As part of the [Open Soruce Development Course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/) I am collecting data about how corporations, universities, non-profits, and governments handle open source. One of the really nice examples I bumped into is that of the [City of Sault Ste. Marie](https://cityssm.github.io/) in the Province of Ontario, Canada.

Not only do they have a nice listing of their GitHub repositories, they also maintain a table called [Canadian Municipal GitHub Rankings](https://cityssm.github.io/municipal-github-rankings/)



The page listing their own projects comes from [this repository](https://github.com/cityssm/cityssm.github.io). It is a simple, but nice HTML file maintained manually. It uses various <a href="https://shields.io/">Shields.io</a> badges to display information about the projects.

The page comparing the GitHub presence of the other municipalities is more complex. It is located in the [municipal-github-rankings](https://github.com/cityssm/municipal-github-rankings)
