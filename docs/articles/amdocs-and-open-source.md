[Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com/) is one of the oldest hi-tech companies in Israel.

When searching for Open Source at Amdocs the top hit is the [Ginger](https://ginger.amdocs.com/) which is an Open source automation framework hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ginger-Automation/Ginger).

Amdocs also has a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/open-amdocs) with 10 projects but without a lot of recent activity.

The Head of Cross Engineering at Amdocs, Jeremy Smith had a short video with the title
[What's the Fuss About Foss?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDhSxFtWNv8),
but I have not a lot of information on the Open source code they redistribute or if they contribute anything beyond what was already mentioned above.

There is also a blog called [Open Amdocs](https://open-amdocs.github.io/) but it has not been updated for 5 years.
