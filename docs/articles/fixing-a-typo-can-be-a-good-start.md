I particiaped in the 2 days of [PyCon Israel 2023](https://2023.pycon.org.il/) where [Irit Katriel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irit-katriel/) was the opening keynote speaker.
I had the good luck of meeting her at the speakers dinner the evening before the conference and then also during the workshop days.

Among many other things we talked a bit about open source contributions. Probably partially as I was leading a workshop getting the partcipants
to send their first pull-requests to open source projects.

She mentioned that one of her first contributions to the [Python core](https://github.com/python/cpython/) was a [typo fix](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/21879/files) which was then approved by [Guido van Rossum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-van-rossum-4a0756/), the creator of Python. I can imagine the ego boost, even though looking at her resume, I don't think Irit needed that.

Now she is an employee at Microsoft full-time working on Python sending lots of [pull-requests](https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Airitkatriel).

A few things I take away from this:

* You don't shy away from a typo-fix even if you are an already accomplished developer with many years of experience.
* It's ok to start with small contributions. Your work will be noticed and as you get involved more your status will grow.
* You don't need a lot of expertise to get your name into a big project: just find a typo to fix or make an improvement in the documentation.
* I did not know that these days [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) has full-time employees working on Python and that even while working at the [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com/)
she was already [encourgaed to contribute to cpython](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2022/11/21/pydev-of-the-week-irit-katriel/).
