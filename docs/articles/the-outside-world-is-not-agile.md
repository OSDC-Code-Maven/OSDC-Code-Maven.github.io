This is based on a conversation I had with a VP R&D at a mid-sized hi-tech company.
My conversation partner preferred that I leave out the name of the company.

Ww know that in many cases having an agile development team can provide much better results than using the waterfall methodology,
but in many cases the outside world does not appreciate it.

For example at this company he managed to get the development team to move from one release every 6 months to 3-week sprints that end with a
release, but the clients did not want to receive the update. This is a B2B SAS business meaning that the clients are businesses, but the software
runs as a web application on the computers of the company that develops the software and provide the service.

So technically they could even get to the point where they deploy a new version every few hours, but the client does not want that.
More specifically the clients do not want changes in the UI and the regular behavior of the software.
