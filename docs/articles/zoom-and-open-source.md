In this series we take a look at a number of corporations that use open source projects to see how they use them and how they talk about them.

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) gained a lot of attention at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. I also started to use it then.
As I run Ubuntu Linux on my notebook I was glad to see that they support it.

## Open Source redistributed by Zoom

Inside the application, in the **Help/About Zoom** menu item there is a link to the Open Source packages they use.

On their web site there is a [list of open source projects](https://explore.zoom.us/en/opensource/) they use. Unfortunately the list looks like they have stopped
maintaining it. There were monthly entries between January 2021 and November 2022, but no entries since then. (I am writing this in March 2023.)
As I understand behind each link there is a text file containing the names and version numbers of the open source packages they use along with the licenses.
In these files there are no links to the source code of the packages.

"Zoom uses the open source software (OSS) components listed below in its products distributions."

There is a separate page with another [list of open source packages](https://explore.zoom.us/en/opensource/source/) that are links to zip, jar, tar.gz files
apparently containing the source code of the open source packages they include in their distributions. Interestingly there are several projects that are listed multiple times with different version numbers.

There are no links to the GitHub (or other VCS) repositories of these projects.

There is also **no mapping** between the versions of the Zoom products and the open source packages.

## Open Source created by Zoom

Zoom also has a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/zoom) where they share some open source code.

Their projects are not very popular, but two of them have more than 500 stars. One of them is an SDK demo and the other is a Cryptography Whitepaper.
