# Projects

List of projects by members of the community that are explicitly supported via the [community chat](https://osdc.zulipchat.com/) server.
See also the generic list of [Open Source projects](/os-projects) and how to find one for yourself to contribute to.

There are projects in several programming languages. Most need help with UI/UX. Some don't need knowledge in any programming language.

## The Diggers

Collecting information about 3rd-party packages. (Meta data, Continuous Integration, tests, etc.)

* [PyDigger for Python](https://pydigger.com/) - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com) (Python, MongoDB, Bootstrap, a little JQuery)
* [CPAN Digger for Perl](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/) - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/CPAN-Digger/) (Perl, Bootstrap, a little JQuery)
* [Ruby Digger](https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/) - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/ruby-digger) (Ruby, Bootstrap, a little JQuery)

Each one is written in its own programming language.

In the planning phase are

* [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/) - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/rust-digger) (Rust)
* NodeJS/JavaScript Digger - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/jsdigger)
* PHP Digger - [source](https://github.com/szabgab/php-digger) (PHP)

## The slides

The source of all the [slides](href="https://code-maven.com/slides/) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/slides).
The code that generates the HTML pages from the slides is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/slider-py) (written in Python).
There are tons of things that need to be improved in the content of the slides and I many in the presentation and in general the generation of HTML pages.

## Kantoniko - Ladino (Python, Bulma, JQuery)

[Kantoniko](https://kantoniko.com/) is a project to help maintain and teach the Ladino language. (Also known as Judeo-Espanyol).
It is divided into several repositories, but everything can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kantoniko/).

Here you can find [all the open issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Akantoniko%20state%3Aopen&type=issues), but I am sure there
are many other things that can and should be done that are not listed there.

## OSDC Code-Maven (Python, Bulma, JQuery)

The [OSDC Code-Maven](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/) organization on GitHub contains the source code of this web site, and the code
that generates all the [instances](https://osdc.code-maven.com/instances).

This is the page that lists all the [open issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOSDC-Code-Maven%20state%3Aopen&type=issues) in this organization.

Including the list of open source projects by organizations:

## List of Open Source by organizations (Python, Bulma, JQuery)

The list of [Open Source projects by organizations](https://osdc.code-maven.com/open-source-by-organizations/) is a sub-page of the OSDC-web site, but
it has its own [repository](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/open-source-by-organizations/). One does not need any programming knowledge to add
more entries to our database, but there are also plenty of development and design tasks.

## Code-Maven and PerlMaven web sites (Perl)

The source of the content of the [Code-Maven](https://code-maven.com/) web site is [here](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/).

The source of the content of the [PerlMaven](https://perlmaven.com/) web site is [here](https://github.com/szabgab/perlmaven.com/)

The code that generates the web site is written in Perl and can be found [here](https://github.com/szabgab/Perl-Maven).

## Other projects by active members of the community

There are many other projects in the [GitHub account of Gabor Szabo](https://github.com/szabgab/). Check those out. Some of them might be interesting to you.

A bunch of those are examples for [GitHub Actions](https://code-maven.com/github-actions).
