# Finding Open Source Projects

Several direction how to select an Open Source project to contribute to.

## Non-coding projects.

There are plenty of projects that need contribution where programming is not involved. Some of these projects are listed in the [here](https://github.com/szabgab/awesome-for-non-programmers),
but there are many more.

## Projects by your school or by your workplace

If you study at a university, college, or maybe work at a research institute, labs in your organization probably have already published projects under some open source license.
You can search GitHub, you can ask around and we also already have a [list of higher education institutions](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-higher-education)
that published open source code. You might already find the projects there.

There are quite a few [government organization](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-government) around the world that published open source code. Some of those are already in our list.

We also have a [list of corporations](https://github.com/szabgab/open-source-by-corporations) that published open source code. Contributing to these projects might help you pave your way to work at the specific organizations.

## Projects you use

If in your research you already use third-party libraries, it is a good idea to look at those and see if you can contribute there.
That would probably primarily mean biology, chemistry, etc. related projects, but they can also be more generic projects such as graph and image generation or matrix manipulation projects.

## Projects people marked as easy

People add tags to their projects on GitHub. There are many tags in use, some of those that might indicate issues that are suited for people who are beginners
either in the GitHub contribution process or in the specific technology, or even in general in software development.

* [beginner](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Abeginner)
* [beginner friendly](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22)
* [good first issue](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* [help wanted](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
* [up for grabs](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22)
* [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahacktoberfest)
* probably there are more...

In addition to filtering by tag you could also filter by programming language to further narrow down the possibilities.

## Diggers (Meta data, Continuous Integration, tests)

We currently have 3 projects that collect information about 3rd-party packages and try to help you find you low-hanging-fruits. You can use them to find projects to contribute to
or you can contribute to the diggers themselves:

* [PyDigger for Python](https://pydigger.com/)
* [CPAN Digger for Perl](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/)
* [Ruby Digger](https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/)
