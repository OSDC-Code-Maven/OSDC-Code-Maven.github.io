# Projects

This is the list of projects by myself. See also the generic list of [Open Source projects](/os-projects) and how to find one for yourself to contribute to.


## The Diggers

Collecting in(Meta data, Continuous Integration, tests)

Collecting information about 3rd-party packages.

* [PyDigger for Python](https://pydigger.com/)
* [CPAN Digger for Perl](https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/)
* [Ruby Digger](https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/)

Each on is written in its own programming language.

In the planning phase are

* Rust Digger
* NodeJS/JavaScript Digger
* PHP Digger

## The slides

The source of all the <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/">slides</a> can be found on <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/slides">GitHub</a>.
The code that generates the HTML pages from the slides is also on <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/slider-py">GitHub</a> (written in Python).
There are tons of things that need to be improved in the content of the slides and I many in the presentation and in general the generation of HTML pages.

## Kantoniko - Ladino

[Kantoniko](https://kantoniko.com/) is a project to help maintain and teach the Ladino language. (Also known as Judeo-Espanyol).
It is divided into several repositories, but everything can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kantoniko/">GitHub</a>.

Here you can find [all the open issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Akantoniko%20state%3Aopen&type=issues), but I am sure there
are many other things that can and should be done that are not listed there.

## OSDC Code-Maven

The [OSDC Code-Maven](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/) organization on GitHub contains the source code of this web site, and the code
that generates all the [instances](https://osdc.code-maven.com/instances).

This is the page that lists all the [open issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOSDC-Code-Maven%20state%3Aopen&type=issues) in this organization.

Including the list of open source projects by organizations:

## List of Open Source by organizations

The list of [Open Source projects by organizations](https://osdc.code-maven.com/open-source-by-organizations/) is a sub-page of the OSDC-web site, but
it has its own [repository](https://github.com/OSDC-Code-Maven/open-source-by-organizations/). One does not need any programming knowladge to add
more entries to our database, but there are also plenty of development and design tasks.

## Code-Maven and PerlMaven web sites

The source of the content of the [Code-Maven](https://code-maven.com/) web site is [here](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/).

The source of the content of the [PerlMaven](https://perlmaven.com/) web site is [here](https://github.com/szabgab/perlmaven.com/)

The code that generates the web site is written in Perl and can be found [here](https://github.com/szabgab/Perl-Maven).

## Other projects by Gabor

There are many other projects in [my GitHub account](https://github.com/szabgab/). Check those out. Some of them might be interesting to you.

A bunch of those are examples for [GitHub Actions](https://code-maven.com/github-actions).
