# Handbook

## Introduction

This is the OSDC handbook.
The inspiration comes from the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">GitLab Handbook</a> and the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/">GitLab CEO Handbook</a>
or at least what I imagine they contain as I have not yet read them.

## What does OSDC stand for?

The first time I encountered the OSDC acronym was when I heard about the "Open Source Developers' Conference" in Australia. I used the name in 2006 to organize an even in Israel.
More recently I saw it being used as "Open Source Developers' Club". In December 2022 I started to use it as "Open Source Development Course(s)" escaping the need for the apostrophe.
Then in June 2023 I realized the C can also stand for Company or Corporation. Somehow all of these might fit us.

* Open Source Development Course(s)
* Open Source Development Club
* Open Source Development Conference
* Open Source Development Company
* Open Source Development Corporation

## Goals

* Helping companies handle Open Source code better.

## Solutions

* Training - teach employees and future employees (students) about Free Software, Open Source, how to contribute etc.
* Maintenance - contract to maintain certain open source libraries.
* Measurement - it is probably not a solution, but it is needed to be able to understand the level of security, legal, technical, and other risks.

## Products and Services

Under [Solutions](#solutions) I described a few potential revenue sources, but in reality I am not sure how well these source can generate revenue.
I do some training, but the world of training changed a lot.
I don't know if companies will be interested in the maintenance of open source project and if they are ready to pay for that or if something else need to be sold to them.

For now I try to describe the way I would like to work in this company.

## Goals and Values

* Being remote is not the goal. Allowing people from remote areas to work is a goal.
* Reducing time, money, and environment wasted on commuting is a goal.

* Thing should be documented an transparent.

## Culture

Agile and DevOps culture as expressed in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and by core people in the DevOps movement, such as Jez Humble, Gene Kim, David Farley, Nicole Forsgren.

TODO add links to books and articles about Agile and DevOps.

* The Phoenix Project by George Spafford, Kevin Behr, Gene Kim
* The DevOps Handbook by Gene Kim, Patrick Debois, John Willis, Jez Humble, John Allspaw
* Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation by Jez Humble and David Farley

## Work on what you like

At any point in time there are many open issues to work on and there might be many other tasks that are not (yet) listed as issues.
We can have meetings to set priorities, but trying to stick to the exact order of priorities might be difficult and not enjoyable.

We trust people that they have (or that they can develop) an understanding of what is more important and what is less important.
Beyond that we want to allow people to work on the issue or task they find most interesting, valuable, or even fun.
We believe that if people have the freedom to act they will work towards the well being of our projects and our organization.

## Background

I hear plenty of people complaining about their workplace that they don't understand software development and operations. I saw similar issues at many of my clients.
Well, maybe "don't understand" is not the correct way to describe this. Let's find a better description that will help with our understandings.
What we see is that instead of going Agile, they implement Scrum top-down in the organization.
Instead of changing the organization to embrace the ideas behind DevOps, they rename the ops team to DevOps or even create a separate team of "DevOps engineers".

To me this indicates that the majority of companies (or the people in these companies) are not really capable of change. So you need to wait till people move and new
people arrive who have better ideas. Even that probably won't help in most places as there is already an organizational culture that the new people won't be able to change.

So if you want to work in such an organization, either find one or create one yourself.

## Marketing and Promotion

Our ideas, products, and service might be great, but if they don't reach the people who need them then they don't provide the value they can.
So we need to promote them. Let's start by describing some of the channels for promotion:

TODO: We need a lot more ideas and explanation here.

### Global in English

* LinkedIn - posting on personal profiles, posting on the LinkedIn Pages, Linkedin Groups
* Facebook -?


### Local in Hebrew

* Give presentations on Meetups
* Local Open source groups.
