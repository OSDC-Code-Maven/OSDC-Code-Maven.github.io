# Why encourage your employees to contribute to open source projects?

There are plenty of ways how you as an employer will gain from the participation of your employees in the development of open source projects.
By giving them the tools and allocating them time to contribute to open source projects you will make your employers more satisfied which will reduce the turnover.
This will also help you in the recruitment as other will already see that you value your employees. It won't be just a slide in the company presentation.
People will actually see that.

* Your system depends on hundreds or thousands of open source projects. All of these have some bugs or lack some features that would be valuable to your employees.
By encouraging them to fix bugs or add new features you directly help your company as well.

* Get experience in areas that are not in immediate demand at the company, but that can expand the horizons of your employees.

* Bring in new ideas from outside of the company. Looking at different projects people will get fresh perspectives on your own projects as well.

* Professional development. Inside the company people are usually restricted to what the company does, but most people would like to learn more. One way they can do this is by going to work at another company. By providing them the opportunity to work on open source projects you also provide them the opportunity the learn more without leaving your company.

* Flexible thinking: Learn about techniques and technologies that are new in the industry or at least new to the particular developer.

* Learn and practice what the programming community does.

* Even at times when the work in the company isn't the most exciting, contributing to open source projects can provide the satisfaction to bridge the gap.

* By showing to other developers that there are bright people at your company who provide value to the open source code-base of the world they can help you a lot finding new talent.

* It demonstrates social and ethical responsibility, which may attract other like-minded professionals to join.
