# Learning pathes

Let's first describe several "profiles" of people and then fill out the suggestions for them.
If you feel that none of the profiles represent you, let us know in our [chat system](/chat).

## Non-programmer

Background: You don't have any programming background, nor are you familiar with git, GitHub.

There are many areas one can help without any programming background and if you'd like to learn programming we can also provide you directions with that.

Things to learn: (We probably will have to fine-tune this. [talk to us](/chat)!)

* Join the community of the project if there is one.
* Opening issues via GitHub UI
* Pull-request via GitHub UI

### Graphical designer

Many open source projects will be glad to get a nice logo.

### Web designer

Many open source projects will be glad to have a (better) web design. (e.g. we would love that)

## Translator

There are many projects that have localized UI or have (partially) translated documentation.

Some of these use various technologies to help the translators. We'll help you find a project and figure out what to do there.

## Beginner

Background: You have a few months experience programming in some language (e.g. Python, JavaScript), you already used git and GitHub, but not much.

* Practice sending pull-request with non-code changes (data collection)
* Practice setting up local development environments and send the instructions as pull-requests.
* Practice writing tests for small projects and send pull-requests.
* Practice setting up Github Actions for Continuous Integration of small projects.
* Learn about Docker for isolated environments, practice that.

Check out the more specific instructions for [Beginners in Python](/steps-for-python)


## Experienced programmer

Background: You have 10-20 years of experience as a programmer. You know git well, you also used GitHub but mostly only to push and pull.
You never sent a pull-request to a project that did not belong to your employer.

* Practice pull-requests with various non-code contributions.
* Pick a project you are really interested to contribute to, set up development environment


## Maintainer / Owner

You are the original creator or the maintainer of an existing open source project on GitHub and you would like to help other get involved
in open source in general and if possible in your own projects. Your projects don't have their own community servers
or maybe you used to use IRC to chat and these days people prefer other chat systems.

We don't have a learning path for you, but we would be glad if you [joined our community](/chat) helping others.
