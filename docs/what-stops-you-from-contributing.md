# What stops you from working on Open Source?

Let's discuss why some people don't contribute to open source and let's try to see how to overcome those issues.

* Lack of awareness: Many people don't know they can conribute to open source. Especially people who are from outside the hi-tech world who could actually give a lot of diverse input.
    This in itself is an interesting topic, but in this writing let's focus on people who already know what open source is.

* Lack of ambition: Some people don't care. Though there are plenty of reasons to contribute, let's not waste time on people who don't care.

* Lack of capacity: It is understandable that some people just don't have free time or energy to allocate to work on open source or basically any other non-essential activity.
    We can only hope that they situation will improve and one day they will have the time.
    However, there are plenty of cases when people spend a lot of time on various non-essential activities and still claim that they don't have time for OSS.
    I guess they are more in the no-ambition category.
    Actually, on a second thought there are are a number of thing people can do on company time as well. For example if you use an open source project for your work and you encounter
    a bug. Reporting it in a way that is easy to reproduce is both a contribution to the open source project and something that your work needs. You might want to make sure
    that you don't reveal the details about your company and how they use the software, but besides that it is a win-win-win for the company, the open source project, and you.

* People thinking that only code-contribution is real contribution and they don't know how to code.
    For this we already have a remedy. We have to explain, multiple times if necessary, that application-code contribution is just one aspect of work on OSS. Let's list a few others:
    * Community participation, answering questions in the user-forum of the project. (Discord/Slack/Zulip/forum/mailing list/etc.)
    * Reporting bugs in a way that is easy to reproduce.
    * Writing and improving the documentation.
    * Translating the UI or the documentation.
    * Creating graphic design for projects. (e.g. logo)
    * Web design: many projects would benefit from a web site or from a nicer, better web site.

* Requirement to sign a copyright transfer.
    * This is actually rare and usually only happens on projects originated at corporations.
    The process of this signature is actually probably less painful that what you expect, but the easy solution is to avoid such projects.

* Fear of rejection. What if my contribution will not be accepted? What if my contribution will be seen as not good enough?
    * I think all of us have this fear, even people with many years of experience in software development and contribution to open source. So the question how to reduce it and how to handle it.
    * Try to communicate with the maintainer(s) up-front to see if they are responsive and what they think about what you'd like to do.
    * Invest time in understanding the code-base, the style and the contribution process. Bigger and older project tend to have clearer and stricter rules and instructions.
    * Move in small steps. Start with small contributions. Maybe non-code contributions.
    * Find a project where you already know the maintainer or where the maintainer explicitely says s/he would be willing to work with participants.
    * Join one of the open source communities.

* Lack of knowledge about the technical process:
    - using git, github, sending a pull-request, following a project etc.
    - Not understanding how project managers (core developers and maintainers) can control the source code while "anyone can change the code".
    - We address these issues inthe [course](/course).

* Lack of knowledge about the social norms.

* Lack of skills in the domain: Esepcially junior programmers or programmers who are new to a language or framework.
