# Why

We believe that making it easy to contribute to open source projects will allow more people to add more valuable contributions.

There are a number of ways we try to accomplish this.

### Make it easy to find the repository of the project

* Python projects that are distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) can include a link to their repository. However, only 57% of the packages do so.
* Perl project that are distributed via [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) can include a link. However, only 35% do so.
* Ruby project distributed via [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) can include a link.
* ...

### Development environment

Even simple projects can have instruction on how to setup the local development environment and how to run the tests locally.
More popular projects might have instruction on how to contribute to the project.

### Automated test

Projects with automated tests are easier to contribute to as it is easier to verify that the changes did not break anything.
The higher the test coverage the less areas of the code are unprotected.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Actually running the tests on every push and on every pull-request will make the automated tests a lot more valuable.
For GitHub-based projects that would be GitHub Actions.
