# OSDC - Open Source Development Community

We are building a community around the idea of helping people getting started contributing to open source projects.

## Who can participate?

Anyone can participate in our community who will abide by the basic rule of being nice to each other.
You don't have to be an expert programmer. You don't even need to know how to program. There are plenty of things to
do in our community and in Open Source in general that don't involve programming.

## Who should participate?

If you have never contributed to any open source project and would like to do that, we hope we'll be able to help you.
You don't have to be an expert developer, you don't even have to be a developer. There are plenty of tasks for designers,
technical writers, and even for people who are users of an open source application without any particular knowledge in the field.

We would also like to welcome maintainers of open source projects who would like to help people get involved in their projects.


## What are the steps to contribute to an open source project?

It depends on your background, your experience and the type of contribution you'd like to make.
In the following section we'll try to describe various scenarios. If one of them fits you great,
you already have your direction mapped. Join our community, tell us about yourself and tell us about your progress.

If none of them seem to fit then join our community, introduce yourself, describe your situation and we'll try to help you.
