Welcome to OSDC

The goal of the [Open Source Development Course](/course) is to help you get started working on Open Source projects.
It can be given in Higher Educational Institutions, at corporations, and sometimes it is taught to the general public.

The goal of the [Open Source Development Community](/community) is to help each other on our way to contribute to Open Source projects.
