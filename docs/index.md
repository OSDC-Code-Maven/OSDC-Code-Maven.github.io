# OSDC - Open Source Development Course

In this course, participants will learn and practice how to build, maintain, and contribute to open source projects.

This is primarily a **practical course** with lots of hands-on assignments.

## Why this course?

Both in the **industry** and in **academia** use an enormous amount of open source code. Many of these organizations also publish some of the code they write under some [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

These projects need development and maintenance work.

These projects often lack testing.

Unfortunately only a small subset of the people know how to contribute to Open Source projects. This is a much needed skill, both in **industry** and **academia**.

In addition many small utilities and libraries are developed in research labs and in departments of corporations, but in most cases these projects remain inside the local environment. Even other labs and other development teams don't know about them and thus they develop their own partial solution for the same problem. This happens because of lack of communication, lack of a common platform to store these projects, lack of practice. The Open Source method taught in this course can help bridge this gap even for in-house proprietary code.

In this course, participants will learn and practice the technology, the culture, the process of contributing to an open source project and using the same knowledge to improve the development practices of their organizations.

## Who is this course for?

* People who already have some experience in programming either while working in the industry or during their studies.
* Students  of computer sciences, software development, Bachelor or more advanced degree.
* Students of biology, chemistry, physics, earth sciences, etc. Masters or more advanced degrees.

* People **without** any programming background can also participate. They will just have to pick tasks that don't need programming.

## Prerequisites

For those interested in programming tasks:

At least half a year experience programming. The specific programming language is not important. ThereÂ are plenty of Open Source project in most of the programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and even Matlab and R.

Again, people without programming background will have non-programming tasks.

## Focus

The focus of the course can and should be different based on the participants. Employees in the industry will have different needs than biology students doing their research who will have different needs than computer science or software engineering students.

## Details

During the course participants will learn about the Open Source development process and Agile methodologies. They will have the opportunity to get involved in various open source projects and practice the methodologies.

For university students this can help a lot during their studies, for example by fixing issues they encounter in open source packages they use in their research. It will enable them, if your organization agrees, to publish some of the code they develop as open source packages. It will also help those who would like to move on to the industry by teaching them some of the tools that are used there.

The course will include some presentations, and a lot of hands-on work. The hands-on work will include a few artificial examples designed to get the basics, but the majority will be on [real projects](/projects).

## Major topics

* Background of Open Source and Free Software (history, philosophy, motivation, licenses, value).
* Working with Git (add, commit, log, diff, stash, reset, branch, merge, rebase, bisect).
* GitHub: clone, pull, push, fork, pull-request.
* GitHub Issues: opening issues, bug reports, comments, following, etc.
* GitHub Pages: Creating a web site for taking notes, documenting knowledge.
* GitHub Actions: Setting Up CI, collecting data, generating web pages.
* Markdown (GitHub Pages, comments, etc.)
* Some understanding of HTML and CSS
* Using Slack for communication.
* Using Docker to limit the impact of external code on our system.

* [Finding an open source project](/projects) to contribute to.
* Learn reading and understanding code written by other developers.
* Refactoring code.
* Testing: Running test, writing tests, test coverage.
* Static code analyzers, linters, prettifies.
* Generating HTML from the documentation.
* Commenting on each-others pull-requests.
* Fixing bugs.
* Improving the documentation.

* Optional: GitLab, Jenkins, Jira, Trello (issue tracking, task management)

## Format of the course

There might be a few in-person meetings with presentations, but primarily presentations will be in Zoom and they will be also recorded for people who cannot attend. The idea is to allow asynchronous learning and working. Similar to what happens in the Open Source world.

## Length of the course

It is planned that this course will be given throughout a semester of roughly 13 weeks.

Expected workload is roughly 5 hours / week, but it might depend a lot on the background of each participant.

Similar to other skills-courses, the more practice will bring better results.

Grading, in cases where it is relevant, is based on the work done during the course. There is no exam or end-of course project.


## Other

* Participants will be required to maintain a journal of what they learned and what the accomplished. The language of the journal does not matter, but it has to be public.
* Participants will be required to review the work of each other.
* Participants will be required to cooperate.
