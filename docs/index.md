# OSDC

The goal of our project is to help you get started working on Open Source projects.


For this we have developed the [Open Source Development Course](/course). It can be given in Higher Educational Institutions or at corporations. Sometimes it is taught to the general public. You can see the results of the [previous instances](/instances).

We also offer shorter [workshops](/workshops).

We also have (irregular) online events where we help you get started contributing to open source projects. You can read more about these events on the pages designated to the specific programming languages we deal with: [Python](/python), [Rust](/rust), and [Perl](/perl).

The goal of the [Open Source Development Community](/community) is to help each other on our way to contribute to Open Source projects.
[Join the community chat server!](https://osdc.zulipchat.com/).

But [why](/why) would you want to contribute and [why](/why) would you want your employees to have this knowledge?
