# OSDC - Open Source Development Course

In this course, participants will learn and practice how to build, maintain, and contribute to open source projects.

## Why this course?

Both in the industry and in Research at Higher Education Institutions people use an ennourmosu amount of open source code.
Many of these organizations also publish some of the code they write under some OSI approved license.

These projects need development and maintenance work.

Unfortunately only a subset of the people know how to contribute to Open Source projects. This is a much needed skill, both in Industry and Academia.

In this course, participants will learn and practice the technology, the culture, the process of contributing to an open source project.


During the course participants will learn about the Open Source development process and will have the opportunity to get involved in various open source projects.
For university students this can help a lot during their studies, for example by fixing issues they encounter in open source packages they use in their research.
It will enable them, if your organization agrees, to publish some of the code they use as open source packages.
It will also help those who would like to move on to the industry by teaching them some of the tools that are used there.

The course will include some presentations, and a lot of hands-on work.
The hands-on work will include a few artifical examples designed to get the basics, but the majority will be on real projects.
We will work on the source code they write in their research, if necessary in private GitHub accounts so the code won't become public.
We will also work on the various biology, chemistry, physics, etc. oriented open source projects they use in their projects.

The students will be encouraged to look at the open source projects published by your institution.

If that's not enough they can also turn to other open source projects that are more generic.
There are tens of thousands open source packages in Python, Matlab, and R on GitHub and GitLab, just to name a few more science-oriented languages.
The students will be able to pick any project in any programming language.

## The assignments will include

* Working with Git/GitHub/GitLab.
* Opening issues, bug reports.
* Commenting on the issues amd bug reports of others.
* Learn reading and understanding code written by other developers.
* Sending Pull-Requests.
* Commenting on each-others pull-requests.
* Writing automated tests.
* Improving the documentation.
* Fixing bugs.
